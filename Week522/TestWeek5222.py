2 - Emojifier-V2: Using LSTMs in Keras:
Let’s build an LSTM model that takes as input word sequences.
 This model will be able to take word ordering into account.
 Emojifier-V2 will continue to use pre-trained word embeddings to represent words,
 but will feed them into an LSTM, whose job it is to predict the most appropriate emoji.
